## What is Kash?

Kash (“Knowledge Agent SHell”) is an interactive command-line power tool for practical
knowledge tasks. It’s an early prototype for the exploration of what’s possible with the
myriad of AI tools we now have.

Currently I'm using it with **OpenAI GPT-4o and o1**, **Anthropic Claude 3.5/3.7**,
**Groq Llama, Qwen, and Deepseek models** (and any others via **LiteLLM**),
**Deepgram**, **Firecrawl**, **Exa**, **LlamaIndex**, **ChromaDB**, and other Python
tools.

Use commands to do deep research, transcribe videos, summarize and organize transcripts
and notes, write blog posts, extract or visualize concepts, check citations, convert
notes to PDFs or beautifully formatted HTML, or perform numerous other content-related
tasks possible by orchestrating AI tools in the right ways.

Without really meaning to, I've found that I also built a replacement for my usual
shell, which I find is more powerful for local usage than than bash/zsh/fish.
For example, it has better help and tab completion than a regular shell.
But the hope is for it to be usable by anyone reasonably technical, and not esoteric
like typical Unix shells.
